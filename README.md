# FrontLineEducationSolution
This is a console application using Java 11 and Junit 5.

It implements two features:

## Part 1: 
    Find the longest monotone sub-array from an array of numbers.

## Part 2:
    (1) Implement a method to convert a sequence of records into a hierarchical (tree) sorted structure.
    (2) Provide a method to print the resulting tree structure.
         
## Installation (Run the following command):
    mvn clean install
   
   This will compile, run the test suite and create the executable Jar file.
    
 
 ## Execution (Execute the Jar file):
    java -jar FrontlineEducationSolution-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
 
 The application will run and the result are shown on the console (System.out).
 
 The input for Part 1 should be in a file named: 
 ### "input_part1.txt"
    Each line represents the input array, a comma separated list of integers.
    It support multiple lines, in  this case each line is consider a separated input array.
    The output is generated for each line.
 
 The input for Part 2 should be in a file named: 
 ### "input_part2.txt"
    Each line represents a record of the input, this should be a string such as "1.2.3".
    A sample content of the file would be:
    1.2.3
    1.2.5
    1.5.6
    1.2.4
    2.5.6
    1.5.7
    2.5.3
 
 These files must be the same folder as the "FrontlineEducationSolution-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" file.
 
 There are sample files for "input_part1.txt" and "input_part2.txt" in the repository of this project.
